Danew's Mini Boss NPC Adds A Brand New NPC To The Game: The Arch Wizard!
He Sells Summoning Items for various Mini-Bosses And Event Bosses (So, kinda like Fargo's Mutant)

Currently Supported mods: Spirit

Since there isn't an official definition for a 'Mini Boss' most of the summon items are for enemies that can prove to be quite the challenge at the point they are fought.
If there are any other enemies/bosses you feel need to be added be sure to let me know on the forum thread.
Hope you enjoy the mod!
