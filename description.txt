Danew's Mini Boss NPC Adds A Brand New NPC To The Game: The Arch Wizard!
He Sells Summoning Items for various Mini-Bosses And Event Bosses (So, kinda like Fargo's Mutant)

Currently Supported mods: Calamity, Thorium, Spirit, Tremor, GRealm and Nightmares Unleashed

Since there isn't an official definition for a 'Mini Boss' most of the summon items are for enemies that can prove to be quite the challenge at the point they are fought.
If there are any other enemies/bosses you feel need to be added be sure to let me know on the forum thread.
Also let me know what other mods to support.
Hope you enjoy the mod!
